  In this blog post, It will be talking about the steps I took to extend the MIPS single-cycle processor into a 5-stage pipeline. Adding the pipeline registers, Adding the forwarding functionality, Adding the Load Word data hazard handler, Adding the Branch data dependency handler. Adding the pipeline registers: In my previous blog post, I went through the steps I took to build a MIPS single-cycle processor in Verilog, test on ModelSim, and implement a BNE, To extend the MIPS single-cycle processor into a pipeline, I first added the pipeline registers. (I removed the PC MUX for now) Note that this 5-stage pipeline cannot use the branch instruction, and does not resolve hazards. I used runto run 10 ps at a time (the clock period is 10 ps). I used the $display() to output the program counter, and show which pipeline stage the instruction is in within the console. Adding the forwarding functionality: The next step was to allow hazards to be resolved. I added a forwarding functionality, The EX result of the addi $s1 $zero 1 instruction will be forwarded to the EX stage of the addi $s2 $s1 2 instruction as it uses $s1. The MEM result of the addi $s1 $zero 1 instruction, and the EX result of the addi $s2 $s1 2 instruction will be forwarded to the EX stage of the addi $s3 $s1 $s2 instruction as it uses both $s1 and $s2. On each run, it runs one clock and also outputs the forwarding information. In the end, $s3 is 4, so this was confirmed to run as expected. Adding the Load Word data hazard handler: The lw (load word) data is only available after the MEM stage. Therefore, we must add a stall functionality to the hazard unit. The instruction lw $s0, 0x4($zero) will forward the MEM result to the EX stage of add $t0, $s0, $s1 as it uses $s0. This instruction is right after the lw , so a stall cycle is inserted between the ID and EX stages.A stall cycle is also inserted between the IF and ID stage of the add $t1, $s2, $s0. The output on ModelSim shows that lwstall occurred on cycle 6 ( lwstall=1 ), and in the end, $t2 is 4, which confirms that the load word functionality works as expected.
